# Splunk-
Splunk dashboards, detections, and queries for security monitoring and threat hunting
This repository contains my Splunk projects focused on security operations and threat detection. It includes custom dashboards, correlation searches, and detection rules built for real-world SOC environments.

The goal is to showcase practical ways to analyze logs, detect anomalies, and visualize data effectively using SPL. Each example is designed to be easy to adapt for your own use casesâ€”whether for incident response, threat hunting, or general monitoring.
